;;7.3  The following program doesn't work. Why not? Fix it.

(define (superlative adjective word)
  (se (word adjective 'est) word))

;;It's supposed to work like this:

> (superlative 'dumb 'exercise)
(DUMBEST EXERCISE)

;;my answer

;;It doesn't work because one of the 'variables' has the same name as a ;;procedure.

(define (superlative adjective wd)  
 (se (word adjective 'est) wd))

;;that works.

;;7.4  What does this procedure do? Explain how it manages to work.

(define (sum-square a b)
  (let ((+ *)
        (* +))
    (* (+ a a) (+ b b))))

;;my answer

;;it works because it makes + equal to * and * equal to +.
